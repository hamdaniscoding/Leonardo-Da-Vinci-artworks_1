Leonardo da Vinci was a Renaissance master known for his innovative techniques in painting and drawing. He often used oil paints for rich colors and smooth blending, tempera for quick-drying detailed work, and ink or metal point for precise sketches. His experiments with materials and methods, like sfumato and layered pigments, gave his artworks their lifelike depth and timeless beauty.
